A description of any known compile or runtime errors, code limitations, or deviations
from the assignment specification (if applicable):
- Ch3Ex6.java - The math calculations for the fibonnaci sequence is wrong so
the answer is not correct
- Ch3Ex7.java - the user is not asked for inputs and the calculations are wrong
- Ch3Ex8.java - each letter is not a unique number
- Ch3Ex10.java - The random 'roll' does not work, and players will randomly get
points
